This repository contains the code for the paper of Computer Science for Business Analytics of Julian Jager, 690694. All code used is given in the 'Python Code' file. Some parts of the code might overlap with my 'coding buddy', Thijs Vink. The code consists of 9 parts: 1) file preparation; 2) data preparation; 3) binary vector creation; 4) signature matrix creation; 5) LSH creation; 6) similarity metrics creation; 7) dissimilarity creation; 8) MSM creation; 9) bootstrapping.
